Monitor the state & evolution of your moles to prevent skin cancer.


**About:**
I'm [a Julian](https://julianivaldy.com/), several members of my family have died of skin cancer. It hit me hard. As I'm being closely monitored, I created this system for my own use and that of my family. I thought I'd share the code rather than throw it in the garbage can - it might be useful to others.


**Contribute:**
This is an open-source (and non-profit!) system. All contributions are welcome.

**Open grants:**
- G01: Develop a mole picture scanner feature to analyze & score moles based on the ABCDE framework: $100
- G02: Develop a mole video live scanner feature to analyze & score moles based on the ABCDE framework: $150
- G03: Develop a mole mapping feature to perform targeted & intelligent monitoring of moles each year and track their evolution: $500
