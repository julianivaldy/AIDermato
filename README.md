Monitor the state & evolution of your moles to prevent skin cancer.


**About:**
I'm [a Julian](https://julianivaldy.com/), several members of my family have died of skin cancer. It hit me hard. As I'm being closely monitored, I created this system for my own use and that of my family. I thought I'd share the code rather than throw it in the garbage can - it might be useful to others.


**Contribute:**
This is an open-source (and non-profit!) system. All contributions are welcome.

**Open grants:**
Open grants (funded by myself âœŠ):

- Develop a photo scanner feature to analyze and score moles based on the ABCDE framework: $100
- Develop a video live scanner feature to analyze and score moles based on the ABCDE framework: $150
- Develop a mapping function to map moles on your body. Every year, you can make a new map and analyze the evolution of moles: $500.
